## Save As Helper
Save As Helper is a simple add-on that will help you to save a duplicate file in one shortcut.

## Why I Would need to save duplicate files?
If you have any problems like:

- Corrupted file

- Your file doesn't open anymore

- No More "ctrl+Z" Actions

- Would like to continue to work on an older version of your file

- Any other problem that will be a big problem if you have only one file.

Duplicating files, you can easily "go back some versions" and continue to work.
